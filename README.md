WhatDidILike iPhone app, Version 2

WhatDidILike lets you keep track of meals you like at restaurants.

This is Version 2 of an [existing app on the Apple App store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whatdidilike/id599324165?mt=8&uo=4&ls=1) ([also see](http://spasticmuffin.biz/?page=WhatDidILike&appPage=home)).

This version of the app will be open-source. I also plan to integrate [SyncServerII](https://crspybits.github.io/SyncServerII/) so that you can share your favorites and also never lose them!
